Pre-requisites:
1. Super User Access in Linux OS

Run on eos, Linux Lab Machine (Realm RHEnterprise 6), jdk using the following commands:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Compile the code by typing "gcc Q8_aramase -lm -o Q8_aramase"

STEP 2: Run the linux executable file by typing "./Q8_aramase" 

STEP 3: After the program terminates the output will be printed on the terminal window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Same steps can be used for running the program - Q9_aramase.c

The MALTAB program is run to provide the output for question 8 and also produce the graph for pmf.

1. Make a MATLAB reservation on VCL.

2. Load the program Q8_aramase.m into MATLAB and run the program.

3. Enter the number of trials.

4. The plot of pmf will be generated after the program terminates.
